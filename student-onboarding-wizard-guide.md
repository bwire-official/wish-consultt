Student Onboarding Wizard: A Step-by-Step Plan
Goal: To create a welcoming experience for new students, personalize their dashboard, and set them up for success from the very first login.

Step 1: The Welcome Mat
What it is: A clean, friendly welcome screen that appears immediately after their first login or after they verify their email.

Purpose: To greet the user by name and set a positive tone. It confirms their account is ready and introduces the quick setup process.

UI:

Big, friendly headline: Welcome, [User's Full Name]!

Short text: "Let's personalize your learning experience. It'll only take a minute."

A single, clear button: [ Let's Get Started ]

Step 2: Create Your Profile
What it is: A screen to set up the user's core identity on the platform: their unique username and contact number.

Purpose: To establish a unique identifier for community features and provide an optional contact method.

UI:

Headline: Set up your profile

Username Input:

A text field for username.

The UI should automatically suggest a few options based on their full name (e.g., for "John Doe", suggest johndoe, j_doe, johndoe25).

It must perform a quick check to ensure the username is not already taken.

Phone Number Input:

A text field for phone number with a country code selector.

A clear, secondary button or link next to it: [ Skip for now ]

A primary [ Next ] button.

Step 3: Upload a Profile Picture
What it is: An optional step to upload a photo.

Purpose: To personalize the user's account and make interactions on the platform feel more human.

UI:

Headline: Add a profile picture (optional)

A circular upload area where the user can drag-and-drop an image or click to browse files.

A preview of the uploaded image.

A primary [ Next ] button and a secondary [ Skip ] button.

Step 4: Your Professional Identity
What it is: A form to gather essential professional details.

Purpose: This is the most critical step for personalizing their content. It helps us understand who they are in the medical world.

UI:

Headline: What is your current role?

Dropdown Menu or Selectable Cards:

Medical Student

Intern / House Officer

Resident / Registrar

Consultant / Attending Physician

Nurse / Nursing Student

Pharmacist

Other Healthcare Professional

Text Input (Optional): What is your specialty? (e.g., Cardiology, Pediatrics)

A [ Next ] button.

Step 5: Define Your Goals
What it is: A screen where they select what they hope to achieve with the platform.

Purpose: To understand their motivation. This helps us frame our communication with them and suggest the most relevant courses later on.

UI:

Headline: What brings you to Wish Consult?

Checkboxes (allow multiple selections):

[ ] Passing my professional exams

[ ] Staying updated with the latest medical knowledge

[ ] Deepening my knowledge in a specific area

[ ] Earning CME/CPD points

[ ] Just exploring

Step 6: Pick Your Interests
What it is: A visual, engaging way for them to select topics they care about.

Purpose: This directly feeds the recommendation engine for their dashboard. The topics they pick here can influence which "Discover New Courses" are shown most prominently.

UI:

Headline: Select your topics of interest

A grid of selectable cards/tags with icons:

Cardiology

Surgery

Pediatrics

Pharmacology

Neurology

Oncology

Public Health

(and so on...)

Step 7: The Finishing Line
What it is: A final confirmation and congratulations screen.

Purpose: To end the process on a high note and give them a clear next step. It confirms their setup is complete.

UI:

Big checkmark icon âœ…

Headline: You're all set!

Text: "Your personalized dashboard is ready. We've tailored it based on your goals and interests."

A single, final button: [ Go to My Dashboard ]

This button would then take them to their main dashboard, which would now feel like it was made just for them. This flow is quick, purposeful, and sets the stage for a great user experience.
