Affiliate Onboarding Wizard: A Step-by-Step Plan
Goal: To properly set up a new affiliate partner, collect their promotional and payment information, and provide them with their unique referral link so they can start earning.

Step 1: Welcome & Introduction
What it is: A clean, professional welcome screen that appears the first time they log in.

Purpose: To welcome them as a new partner and briefly explain that the next few steps are to set up their affiliate account.

UI:

Headline: Welcome to the Wish Consult Affiliate Program!

Short text: "Let's set up your partner account. It'll just take a moment to get you ready to start earning."

A single button: [ Begin Setup ]

Step 2: Choose Your Public Identity
What it is: A screen to set up their public-facing username.

Purpose: This is crucial. The username gives them a unique identity on the platform and can be used for a vanity referral link.

UI:

Headline: Choose Your Unique Username

Username Input:

A text field for username.

The UI should suggest options based on their full name.

Crucially, it must perform a live check against the database to ensure the username is not already taken.

A [ Next ] button.

Step 3: Tell Us About Your Audience
What it is: A short form to understand how they will promote the platform.

Purpose: This is for you, the admin. It helps you understand your marketers and ensures they are a good fit for your brand.

UI:

Headline: How Will You Promote Us?

Website/Social Media Link (Optional): A text field for their primary URL.

Promotion Method (Dropdown or Checkboxes): Blog, Social Media, YouTube, etc.

A [ Next ] button.

Step 4: Tell Us About Yourself (Optional)
What it is: A step to collect optional demographic information.

Purpose: For internal analytics to help you understand your affiliate base.

UI:

Headline: About You (Optional)

Nationality (Dropdown of countries)

Gender (Selectable options: Male, Female, Prefer not to say)

A clear [ Save & Continue ] button and a highly visible [ Skip This Step ] link.

Step 5: Your Link is Ready!
What it is: The final "reward" screen.

Purpose: To confirm their setup is complete and provide them with their referral link. Payout details will be requested later within their dashboard when they initiate a withdrawal.

UI:

Big checkmark icon âœ…

Headline: You're Ready to Start Earning!

The Referral Link Display: A read-only text box with their link and a [ Copy Link ] button.
